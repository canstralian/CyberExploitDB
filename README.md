## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Includes a wide range of known cyber exploits and vulnerability data.
- **Intuitive Interface:** Easy-to-use Streamlit application for data interaction and visualization.
- **Community Support:** Open to contributions for continual improvement and updates.

## Performance Metrics
The utility of this dataset can be evaluated based on its effectiveness in identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities. Performance can be quantified through metrics such as detection rates and false positive reduction in applied cybersecurity tools.

## Ethical Considerations
- **Responsible Usage:** Users should ensure ethical use, focusing on security enhancement rather than exploitation.
- **Privacy:** Care should be taken to respect privacy when handling sensitive data.

## Limitations and Biases
- **Limited Dataset Size:** As a small dataset, it may not capture all possible exploits or up-to-date threats.
- **Potential Bias:** Data may lean towards well-documented threats, not reflecting emerging vulnerabilities adequately.
